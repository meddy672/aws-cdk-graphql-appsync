# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project!

This is a Graphql API built with AWS AppSync, DynamoDB and Lambda. The application was generated using the AWS CDK CLI and uses Typescript as the development langauge. For more information on using the AWS CDK with Typescript [visit AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with-cdk-typescript.html).

## Getting Started
The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
